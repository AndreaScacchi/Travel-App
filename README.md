### Udacity Nanodegree Front-End Web Developer, ***Travel App***.

This is the last project in the program and there are many steps to do to build it. However it's an amazing challenge, and Thanks to [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) for this project!

In this project I used:
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **DOM**
- **JSON**
- **NPM**
- **Node.js**
- **Express**
- **Sass**
- **Babel**
- **Jest**
- **Webpack**

Also:
- **API's** like:
* [GeoNames](https://www.geonames.org/) API in order to retrieve the destinations latitude and longitude. 
* [Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/) API in order to retrieve the weather.
* [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) API in order to retrieve a picture of destination city.

I also created a to do list, that seems a mini app inside the main app.

Moreover, I want to Thanks the community that is full of developers that help you anytime, and also the mentors and the reviewers, that are a fundamental part to reach the goals and understand how to face and fix the problems!
